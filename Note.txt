Array Methods :
--------------

1. Array properties
    
     length

     Example:

        const arr =[5,4,6];
        console.log(arr.length);

Section 2. Adding / removing elements
--------------------------------------
  Stack , LIFO
  --------------
  push()
  pop()

  Queue ,FIFO
  --------------
  shift()
  unshift()

  splice() :
  ---------
  JavaScript Array type provides a very powerful splice() method that allows you to insert new elements into the middle of an array. 
  However, you can use this method to delete and replace existing elements as well.
   
  -> For Deleting Element 

     syntax:

        Array.splice(position,num_of_element);

     Example:

        const arr3 = [10,20,30,40,50];
        console.log(arr3);
        const items_deleted = arr3.splice(0,3);
        console.log(arr3);
        console.log(items_deleted);

  -> For Inserting elements

      Syntax :

         Array.splice(position,0,new_element_1,new_element_2,...);    

      Example :

         const arr5 = [20,60,70,80];
         console.log(arr5);
         arr5.splice(0,0,30,40,50);
         console.log(arr5);

   -> To Replace the elements

         let languages = ['C', 'C++', 'Java', 'JavaScript'];
         languages.splice(1, 1, 'Python');
         console.log(languages);

  slice()
  --------
  - slice() method that allows you to extract subset elements of an array and add them to the new array. 

  - The slice() method accepts two optional parameters as follows:
    
     slice(start,stop);

  - Clone an array

    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
    console.log(numbers);
    var newNumbers = numbers.slice();
    console.log(numbers);

    var fruits = ['Apple','Orange','Mango','PineApple'];
console.log(fruits);
var myFruits = fruits.slice();
console.log(myFruits);

var myFavFruits = fruits.slice(2);
console.log(myFavFruits);



var yellowFruits = fruits.slice(1,3); //Excludes end Index
console.log(yellowFruits);

Convert array-like objects into arrays
--------------------------------------
function toArray() {
  return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
}

var classification = toArray('A','B','C');

console.log(classification); // ["A", "B", "C"]


High-order methods :
-------------------

map() – transform array elements.

filter() – filter elements in an array

reduce() – reduce elements of an array to a value.

every() – check if every element in an array passes a test.

some() – check if at least one element in an array passed a test.

sort() – sort elements in an array.

forEach() – loop through array elements.


Template literals (Template strings)
-------------------------------------
Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.





every()

Function in javascript :
-----------------------
- Self defined block which performs some predefined task.

- It provides modularity .

- It facilitates code reusability.

- Funcations are the first class citizen in JS.

- Whole JS concept revolving around the function.

- Syntax :

      function <function_name>(){
         //logic
      }

- Example :
    
      function sum(n1,n2)
      {
          return n1+n2;
      }

   - Anonymous Function

       The function having no name is known as anonymous function.

       function()
       {

       }

   - In JS function name follows CamelCase style.

         simpleIntrest()

   - By convention, the function names are in camelCase and start with verbs like getData(), fetchContents(), and isValid().

   - A function can accept zero, one, or multiple parameters. In the case of multiple parameters, you need to use a comma to separate two parameters.

   - Note:
      Every function in JavaScript implicitly returns undefined unless you explicitly specify a return value.

   - Inside function body there is a redefied object known as 
     arguments .

     Which help to find number of arguments passed to the function
     and arguments values.


   - Note:
      The arguments object behaves like an array though it is not an instance of the Array type.

   - Function Hoisting :

       Function hoisting is a mechanism that the JavaScript engine physically moves function declarations to the top of the code before executing them.


Default Argument in JS Function :

function sum(x=0,y=0)
{
   console.log(`x=$x`);
   console.log(`x=$x`);
   return x+y;
}

let res = sum();
console.log(res);

let res = sum(12);
console.log(res);

let res = sum(12,90);
console.log(res);

Javascript Prototype:
--------------------

- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

- The prototype chain :

- Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. 

- The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain.

- The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

- When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.\



Inheritance in JS :
--------------------

- JavaScript doesn’t use classical inheritance. Instead, it uses prototypal inheritance.

- In prototypal inheritance, an object “inherits” properties from another object via the prototype linkage.

- The [object Object] is the default string representation of an object.

- To access the prototype of the person object, you can use the __proto__ property as follows
  
      console.log(person.__proto__);

- console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
